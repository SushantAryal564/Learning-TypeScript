2. Using Types
   TypeScript type system only helps you during development (i.e before the code gets compiled.)
3. TypeScript Types vs Javascript Types
   Javascript is dynamically typed whereas TypeScript is statically typed. 
6. Tyes Assignment & Type Inference
   Type inferences: Typescript does its best to understand which type we have in the variable or constant. 
7. Object Types:
   Any javaScript object, more specific types (type of object) are possible.
   TypeScript inferes to the type of data in the object.
8. Arrays Types:

   Added to TypeScript: Fixed length array as well as fixed type
